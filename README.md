# InfinityChest
InfinityChest was a plugin I was commissioned to maintain back in 2021. It has now been open-sourced with permission due to it no longer being in use.

The plugin was originally developed by another developer, however, I was the one to maintain it during its operation. The primary change was moving from a singular file for data storage to a per-player JSON document.
