# InfinityChest

InfinityChest was a plugin I was commissioned to maintain. It has now been open-sourced with permission due to the owning server no longer being around.

The main branch was the original plugin lacking my modifications whereas the JSON branch contains my modifications that were made to meet new requirements.
